# UCI Diabetes Dataset — Week 1–2 Project

## 📌 Overview
This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** (UCI ML Repository / Kaggle) as a hands-on exercise to practice the **end-to-end data science workflow**.  
It is the **Week 1–2 deliverable** in my Data Science learning roadmap, focused on healthcare-relevant datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Explore data distributions and identify data quality issues
- Handle missing and invalid values (imputation)
- Visualize relationships between features and diabetes outcomes
- Train baseline classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Reflect on findings, challenges, and next steps
