# Week 3â€“4 â€” UCI Diabetes Dataset

This folder contains the **Week 3â€“4 practice notebook** for my Data Science learning roadmap.  
The focus in this stage is to move beyond baselines and start improving models and insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Notebook
- **`UCI_Diabetes_Week3-4_Starter.ipynb`**  
  Covers:
  - Feature engineering (e.g., derived variables, binning, interactions)
  - Class imbalance strategies (resampling, class weights, threshold tuning)
  - Cross-validation for more reliable performance estimates
  - Model comparisons (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, kNN, plus advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost)
  - Evaluation with additional metrics (ROC-AUC, Precision/Recall Curve)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Name:** Pima Indians Diabetes Database  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Target:** `Outcome` â†’ 1 = Diabetes, 0 = No diabetes  

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Deeper feature selection or dimensionality reduction
- Document performance improvements compared to Week 1â€“2
- Prepare notebook for presentation in portfolio
