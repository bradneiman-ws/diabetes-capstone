# Week 1â€“2 â€” UCI Diabetes Dataset

This folder contains the **Week 1â€“2 practice notebook** for my Data Science learning roadmap.  
The goal is to get hands-on with a healthcare-relevant dataset and practice the end-to-end workflow.

## ðŸ“Œ Notebook
- **`UCI_Diabetes_Week1-2_Starter.ipynb`**  
  Covers:
  - Data loading & inspection  
  - Cleaning missing/invalid values  
  - Exploratory plots  
  - Baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, kNN)  
  - Performance metrics & reflections  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Name:** Pima Indians Diabetes Database  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Target:** `Outcome` â†’ 1 = Diabetes, 0 = No diabetes  

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
- Try feature engineering (BMI bins, interactions)  
- Explore advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Add results summary to main project README
